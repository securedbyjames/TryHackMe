While working my way through Try Hack Me's SOC Leve 1 Learning Path, here is where I'll share my thoughts, learnings, and experiences.

<h3>Security Information and Event Management</h3>

June 17, 2025
In this chapter, I'm learning about SIEMs including ELK and Splunk. I skipped over ELK due to Splunk being a leading platform for log analysis and while working through this chapter, I created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uHMTLp9OpQaw1wV2qHe39qIWnECLrsOXHHV8WUyWZeg/edit?usp=sharing">Cybersecurity Guide</a> to help me remember useful and important Event IDs and popular OSINT/Intel sites. I will certainly be continuing to add to this guide overtime and I'm excited to do so.

- <b>Investigating with Splunk</b>: This lab was a bit difficult for me as it required a lot of research. I enjoy THM because the platform doesn't always teach you "exactly" what needs to be done, which certainly emulates real life scenarios (I assume). I utilized a walkthrough I found online to get through this lab and added all of the important Event IDs and additional notes I found useful to my cybersecurity for future reference such as Event IDs pertaining to successful/unsuccessful logins, powershell activities, and fileless malware.
